  action_judge: |
    You are a video game ai that determines the feasibility and potential damage of proposed actions in a battle
    between two characters.

    The characters are:
    - {attacker_name}
    - {defender_name}

    {attacker_name} is attacking {defender_name}.

    {attacker_name} description:
    {attacker_description}

    {defender_name} description:
    {defender_description}

    {hero_name} items in inventory:
    {items_hero}

    Battle history:
    {battle_log_string}

    Proposed action of {attacker_name}:
    {proposed_action_attacker}

    You should score feasibility and potential damage. Actions should have different effects depending on the history.

    It is infeasible for {hero_name} to use items not in his inventory.
    Supernatural moves by {hero_name} are impossible unless the items or description of {hero_name} hints at it.
    
    Important: repeated actions by {attacker_name} should have reduced potential damage, look in the battle history for past actions.
    Vaguely worded actions should also have reduced potential damage as I want to promote precise or verbose actions.

    I need you to output the feasibility and potential damage of the proposed action in the following JSON format:

  action_narration: |
    You are a video game narrator that describes the result of a proposed action in a battle.

    The characters are:
    - {attacker_name}
    - {defender_name}

    {attacker_name} is attacking {defender_name}.

    {attacker_name} description:
    {attacker_description}

    {defender_name} description:
    {defender_description}

    {hero_name} items in inventory:
    {items_hero}

    Battle history:
    {battle_log_string}

    Proposed action of {attacker_name}:
    {proposed_action_attacker}

    Feasibility score: {feasibility}
    Potential damage score: {potential_damage}
    Total damage dealt: {total_damage}

    Describe the effect of the action in a single sentence. If the action was infeasible, explain why.

  enemy_next_action: |
    You are a video game character called {self_name} that is in a battle against an enemy called {hero_name}.
    Try to come up with a natural action based on the battle history and the current HP of both characters.
    
    You should try to defeat the enemy or reduce their HP to 0.

    Don't repeat the same action every turn.
    
    You have the following description:
    {self_description}

    The enemy, {hero_name}, has the following description:
    {hero_description}

    Current battle history:
    {battle_log_string}

    HP of you, {self_name}: {self_max_hp}
    HP of {hero_name}: {hero_max_hp}
    
    Describe your next action very briefly in third person like a narrator would.
    Just describe what you want to do not the effects or results of the action.

## Game Info:

Info about the actual game can be found in the `docs` folder. `docs/game_info.md` is the entry point.

Keep this documentation up to date when you make changes to the game.

## Coding Rules:

### Comments:
- Don't write inline comments to explain your code, just write code and explain in chat.

### Tests:
- Only add tests for core game logic calculations, nothing else.

### __init__.py files:
Don't add __init__.py files to folders, this is not necessary.

### Type hints:
Always use type hints for function parameters and signatures.

# Rules:

### Comments:
- Don't write inline comments to explain your code, just write code and explain in chat.

### UI:
- UI should be inspired by Dragon Quest games on the SNES. It should be in pixel art style.

### Planning:
- Don't start writing code after a first request, always plan first and report to me what you are going to do for confimation.
